Minetest mod metatools
######################

A mod inspired by mgl512's itemframe issue

# Authors
 - LeMagnesium / Mg / ElectronLibre : Source code writer
 - Ataron : Texture creater

# Purpose
This mod's aim is to provide a way for admins to navigate through any (ok, not
ignores) nodes on the map, and see values of its metadatas at any of their
stratum.

# Media
"metatools_stick.png" by Ataron (CC-BY-NC-SA)

# Todo
 - Add a way to SET the metadatas (will be complicated)
 - Fix the LICENSE

# Special thanks
 - mgl512 (Le_Docteur) for its locked itemframe which gave me the idea of a tool
allowing to see/edit metadatas
 - Ataron who created the stick's texture
